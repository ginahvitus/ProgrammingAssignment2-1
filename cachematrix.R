## The purpose of this of function is to generate
## and solve special matricies and their inverses
## using the two function makeCacheMatrix which
## will provide methods for getting/setting matrix
## and inverse values

## makeCacheMatrix will provide the value
## entries for the cacheSolve function
## specifically determining the get/set
## functions for the matrix and its inverse

makeCacheMatrix <- function(x = matrix()) {

}


## This function solves for the inverse of 
## the cachedMatrix, the product of the
## makeCacheMatrix function

cacheSolve <- function(x, ...) {
        ## Return a matrix that is the inverse of 'x'
}
